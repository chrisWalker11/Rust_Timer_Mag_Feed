# Mag Feeder Written in Rust 
makes noise and flashes red when ready to feed your mag 
# Compilation 
i crossed compiled this for windows but im sure you could also just compile it on windows
you can replace the wav file with any noise probably i just went to a place that had files for like a discord sound board and just downloaded that so keep that in mind

`cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`
